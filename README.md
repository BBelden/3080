## Discrete Structures programs.

**lab1** contains a c++ program that does something with input files. Yeah. I wish I had left a LOT more description in the file. It still works though.

**lab2** contains a c++ implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

**lab3** contains a c++ program that reads in a hamming-encoded packet, does some fancy decoding, and outputs the message.

**lab4** contains a c++ implementation of solving for n-th term of a sequence three ways.
